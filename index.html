        <div class="content">I gathered the dirt required for my dastardly experiments. I have seperated the dirt into cup sized increments and have stored unused samples in a heavily fortified safe with proper temperature controls. My first sample, "dirt 1" is currently under intense observation with the intent on characterizing distinctive, apparant, physical and emotional strengths and weaknesses, which may be useful for further evil experiments.

        <h6 class="dates">Posted: 1/24/2021</h6>
        
        <div class="content">The second cup of dirt which has been selected for my most heinous and disgusting rituals is called "Dirt 2". I will be observing the sample for any sign of conscious decision making or guiding philosophies/principles. Dirt 2 was placed in a simulated situation and asked to make a decision based on its guiding principles. Dirt 2 was placed in front of a lever. In front of the lever was a train track which split into two seperate directions. On one path, Dirt 2's family, the Dirtpiles, were taped to the railroad in line with a speeding train. On the other path was a pile of grass seeds that would surely provide Dirt 2 with the thick grassy main that he has always dreamed of. The train moved forward as Dirt 2 stood frozen in fear. Would he pick his lovgin dirt wife and his very own legacy of dirt children or would he be enticed by the sweet desires of finally being a dirt pile worthy of the greenest and tallest grass around. The train blasted through the dirtpiles as Dirt 2 watched without flinching, in fact, he hadn't budged the whole time. It appears the dirt is motivated purely by self indulgence and does not value anything other than its own gain, a truly evil and vile guiding philosphy. After the test, Dirt 2 was sent for further tests on my SmashBLaster6000.
